Company Valuation Methods

1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:
   - Project future free cash flows
   - Apply discount rate (WACC: Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
   - Calculate terminal value
   - Sum present values
   - Key assumptions: growth rates, discount rate, terminal multiple

2. Comparable Company Analysis (Comps):
   - Find similar companies in same industry
   - Calculate valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S)
   - Apply median or mean multiples to target company
   - Adjust for differences in growth, margins, risk

3. Precedent Transactions:
   - Analyze recent M&A transactions in industry
   - Calculate transaction multiples
   - Apply to target company
   - Often includes control premium (20-40%)

4. Asset-Based Valuation:
   - Sum of all assets minus liabilities
   - Useful for asset-heavy businesses
   - May not capture intangible value

5. Key Valuation Multiples:
   - P/E Ratio: For profitable companies
   - EV/EBITDA: Better for companies with different capital structures
   - P/S Ratio: For companies without earnings
   - P/B Ratio: For asset-heavy companies
   - PEG Ratio: P/E / Growth Rate (lower is better, < 1.0 is attractive)

6. Growth-Adjusted Metrics:
   - PEG Ratio: P/E divided by growth rate
   - EV/Revenue Growth: Enterprise Value / Revenue Growth Rate
   - Rule of 40 (SaaS): Revenue Growth % + Profit Margin % should be > 40%
