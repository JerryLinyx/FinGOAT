Healthcare & Biotech Sector Analysis

Key Metrics for Healthcare Companies:
1. Revenue Growth: Established pharma: 3-8%, Biotech: highly variable based on pipeline
2. Gross Margins: Pharma: 70-85%, Biotech: variable, often negative pre-commercialization
3. R&D as % of Revenue: Pharma: 15-25%, Biotech: 50-100%+ (pre-revenue)
4. Operating Margins: Mature pharma: 20-35%, Biotech: negative until commercialization

Pipeline Analysis (Biotech):
- Phase 1 success rate: ~63%
- Phase 2 success rate: ~31%
- Phase 3 success rate: ~58%
- FDA approval rate: ~85% of Phase 3 submissions
- Time to market: 10-15 years from discovery

Key Healthcare Ratios:
- P/E Ratios: Mature pharma: 12-20x, Biotech: often N/A (no earnings)
- Price-to-Sales: Biotech: 5-20x (pre-revenue), Mature: 3-6x
- R&D Efficiency: Revenue per R&D dollar spent

Healthcare Sector Considerations:
- Regulatory approval risks (FDA, EMA)
- Patent expiration (patent cliff)
- Generic competition
- Reimbursement changes
- Clinical trial outcomes
- Pipeline depth and quality
